                                    I enjoy gaming of all kinds. I play all types of video games and collect and play older consoles. I also
                                    play PS5 and Xbox Series X as well as PC gaming on my Alienware. Magic the Gathering is my main card game, 
                                    but I also play a lot of board games with my family.

                                    I love driving my Camaro around and building vehicles. I enjoy the track and drag strip and just cruising around.
                                    I also enjoy pulling engines and building cars

                                <p>
                                    I started out as a state qualified swimmer in high school on the swim team. I then went on to be a lead lifeguard and coach 
                                    two swim teams. I was a co-coach for the city team and a head coach for the YMCA team. This experience taught me so much 
                                    about leadership and I am so happy I pursued this.

                                <p>
                                    I started my programming journey as a Manual tech QA analyst and quickly moved up to QA Engineer. This really got me into
                                    the programming world and I eventually became lead QA on my team.

                                <p>
                                    After manual QA I started in QA automation and I am now a Senior Automation Engineer. I get to use all kinds of different tools
                                    and languages to build custom automation systems that help my company test faster and more effectively. I have now built out many 
                                    custom projects and when I finish this degree, may go full time engineering or management.
