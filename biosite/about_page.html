                &emsp;Stephanie Sullivan was born in Helena Montana and is 29 years old, she is married and has 2 children. 
                She has lived in Helena just about her entire life. She did live in Phoenix Arizona for a year and is moving back this summer. 
                Though Montana is home for her, Arizona provides the weather she enjoys and many more job opportunities. 
                She recently accomplished a major goal by graduating from Colorado State University Global, with her Bachelorâ€™s 
                in Human Resources degree with a minor in Web-Application development. She is currently working as a Staffing Coordinator 
                but hopes to be a Full-fledged Human Resource Generalist very soon. In ten years, her goal is to be a director of
                Human Resources or a high position in a company on her way to that role. Stephanie loves all types of music except for 
                screamo and opera. She loves driving around in her Jeep Gladiator Rubicon with the roof off and nice weather.
                Her favorite color is purple and favorite movies are just about all the original Disney movies. Most notable movies for
                her are, Lilo and Stich, Lion King, Alladin. For fun, Stephanie enjoys reading, building puzzles, 
                playing games (both board games and video games), watching her shows, and shopping. Though her life can be chaos,
                she loves her family and work and is excited for the future.
